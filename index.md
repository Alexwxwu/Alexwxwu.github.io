## About Me
I am a PhD candidate from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Prof. [Helen Meng](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-mei-ling-helen/) and Prof. [Haizhou Li](https://www.colips.org/~eleliha/).
My current research focuses on speech extraction, generative models, and audio-visual learning.  Before that, I obtained my master’s degree in Machine Learning from KTH Royal Institute of Technology through the HIT-KTH 3+2 program, where I finished my master's thesis on vehicle trajectory prediction with Dr. [Yuchao Li](https://yuchaotaigu.github.io/index.html).
